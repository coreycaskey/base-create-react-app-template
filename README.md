# Base Create React App Template

Since Create React App (CRA) has been "deprecated", this repo exists solely as a base template for any future SPAs I want to build using it.

It's largely similar to the package you'd receive running `npx create-react-app {app-name} --template typescript` with some additional configurations that I prefer for my VS Code environment, e.g.

- eslint
- prettier
- TS configurations
- husky

Additionally, this app works locally for me using Node v21.

For all the other README information CRA provides, visit their [GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
